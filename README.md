### Classifying data using Support Vector Machines(SVMs)
In machine learning, Support vector machine(SVM) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis. It is mostly used in classification problems. In this algorithm, each data item is plotted as a point in n-dimensional space (where n is number of features), with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate. Then, classification is performed by finding the hyper-plane that best differentiates the two classes.

In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.

#### How SVM works
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a discriminative classifier formally defined by a separating hyperplane. In other words, given labeled training data (supervised learning), the algorithm outputs an optimal hyperplane which categorizes new examples
